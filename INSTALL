Installing the mzLib C++ library follows standard linux software practices:


./configure
make

The library requires a C++17 compatible compiler, and has a number of additional dependencies that are verfied during the configure step.
To speed up the compilation, you can choose a parallel make, e.g. using 

make -j 8

For running tests, change into the Test directory and run the runtest.sh script. This script will also create softlinks to the required input files.
