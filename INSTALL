Installing the mzLib C++ library follows standard linux software practices:


./configure
make

The library requires a C++17 compatible compiler, and has a number of additional dependencies that are verfied during the configure step.
To speed up the compilation, you can choose a parallel make, e.g. using 

make -j 8

The software has been tested with gcc 8.2, gcc 10.2, and intel icpc 19.0.5, on multiple Linux systems (Redhat 7.6, OpenSuSe 15.2, Arch Linux)
Note: since this is still work in development, the library is by default compiled with debug symbols and without optimization. For any form of performance evaluation,
the user has to disable the setting by using the --disable-debug option during the configure step. Configuration values and options might change in the future.

For running tests, change into the Test directory and run the runtest.sh script. This script will also create softlinks to the required input files.
