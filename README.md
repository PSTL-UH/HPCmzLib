HPCmzLib

This is a C++ version of the mzLib library for mass spectrometry projects, targetting HPC environments.

The original C# version was developed by the L.M. Smith Group https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/mzLib,
which itself is based on code from https://github.com/dbaileychess/CSMSL and distributed under the LGPL license.

The code has been translated to C++ by the PSTL group at the University of Houston.
