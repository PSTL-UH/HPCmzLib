Proteomics/ProteolyticDigestion/ProteaseDictionary.cpp:
 -  check file for location and name of the Protease Dictionary. Currently hardcoded to 'protease.tsv' in the current working directory, but the original logic was more complex.

Proteomics/ProteolyticDigestion/ProteolyticPeptide.cpp:
  - there is potentially a discrepancy between the C# and teh C++ version here. The C# version works on Lists(KeyValuePair(int, List<Modification*>)).
    THere is no KeyValuePair structure in C++, the closest is however a std::unsorted_map. So we map this to
          std::vector<std::unsorted_map<int, std::vector<Modification*>>>
    The Problem with that structure is that each unsorted_map can hold more than one
    key-value pair. For now, every location where the C# KeyValuePair was used, we use the first element in the std::unsorted_map,
    Will have to double check at one point that they truly only contain one element.   


Parallel Processing found in the following files:
 - MassSpectrometry/MsDataFile.h: uses Parallel::ForEach. converted to sequential std::for_each for now.


configure script:
  - will need to add xerces-c-devel if we manage to generate the unimod reader using xsd to the libraries that
    we need to check for.
