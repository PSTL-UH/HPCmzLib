1. The C# yield word returns elements of an array in a succession. There is no
   direct translation to C++ for that. The best way would be to return an
   std::vector for that, but that requires probably code changes on the calling
   side. 
2. The Classes define operator overloads to be able to use the Element
   strucutre, the element number, and the element string as synonyms. This
   does not work in C++. Currently, these methods are commented out, but will
   have to be revisited.
